#+TITLE: ML for the Working Programmer

* Why SML?
For me, it is due to learning Isabelle more effectively; and also as I'm doing
SICP, the functional programming style would works for good.

*** Naming constants
We can name value by declaring with ML keywords ~val~
#+BEGIN_SRC sml :session *sml* :results
val seconds = 60;
seconds
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src org
val it = 60 : int
#+end_src

Note that we have to begin with ~val~ and end with semicolon ~;~.
All the ML statement should end with ~;~ like above--similar to java.
